      # despite looking like light color commands, these are actually parameters to my event
      # handler in attract.py. Each entry is a light and a start and end color. The idea is
      # to dynamically roll the color through a lerped range from the start to the end color.
      # The lerp is based on the loop count. So each entry is telling the code: Set this
      # light to a color that is {loop count} lerped intervals between {start color} and {end color}
